        Nice to meet you. I'm Chi :)<br><br>
        I'm an aspiring Software Developer and currently a Computer Science student at Drexel University.
        But programming aside, art is also one of my passion, and I love to use art to tell story.
        I'm in no way a professional artist, but rather, painting is my hobby, and as far as I concerned, I've painted more
        than I've coded in my life. In particular, I love painting because I can use it to tell so many stories.<br><br>

        My favorite medium to paint with is watercolor. I like the way the pigment flow, how soft the final painting looks because 
        of the transparency of watercolor, and moreover, it's the medium I got exposed to the most. I hope I'll get to play with 
        other mediums someday.
